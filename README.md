# python_number_comparison

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that compares two numbers entered by the user and prints whether the first number is greater than or equal to the second number.

 How It Works
- The program asks the user to enter two numbers.
- It compares the numbers using the `>=` operator.
- The result (`True` or `False`) is printed directly.

Why This Approach?
Using:
```python
print(a >= b)
